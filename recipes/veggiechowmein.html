      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        As with any stir fry, you can use whatever veg you like - roughly 2
        cups' worth. I just used onion, celery and carrot because that's what I
        had on hand, but they also happen to be some of the most accessible and
        inexpensive veg most of us can buy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've never bought oyster sauce before and don't have an Asian
        market nearby, you can probably find it in the Asian section of your
        local big box grocer (including Walmart), Trader Joe's, Whole Foods,
        Cost Plus (World Market), and, of course, online. If you're wary of
        trying oyster sauce because you hate oysters, I can assure you it
        doesn't taste much like oysters at all, and it's a quite delicious and
        versatile condiment that adds a deep, ever so slightly smoky, somewhat
        soy sauce like saltiness to your dishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you use the traditional or cold, shallow water start method of
        boiling pasta, I suggest starting that step before you prep your veg so
        you can work more efficiently. Of course you have to be mindful to watch
        the pasta and take it off the heat before it gets overcooked, but since
        this dish mimics chow mein, and chow mein is a a softer kind of noodle,
        you have a little leeway.
